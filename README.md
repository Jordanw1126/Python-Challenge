# Python-Challenge
In this challenge we were given 2 diffeent spreadsheets with information that we needed to collected data out of. I compleed this assignment through VS code and creating a Python script to collect the data.

In the first half of the activity (PyBank) I need to locate the csv file that had the information that I needed to analyze. So I ceated a csvpath that would help me locate the file.
I then located the csv header to know what column held what information. 
After that I began to look over the instuctions to start building my script 
The first thing I needed to do was find the total of numbers in the dataset by doing that I creaded a code that would count how many rows where in the data sheet
I then needed to find profit/losses
I calculates the change in profit/loss from the previous month to the current month. I got my information from row[1] because that is where the profit/losses where housed.
My code was not successful in finding the average of the change in the profit losses.
Baed off the change in profit I was then able to create a code to find the greatest increase and the greatest decrease in change. By doing that I just set change >, < , or = to greatest decrease and greatest increase 
I finalized this portion f the assignment my printing and exporting my results.

In the second half of the assignment (Pyroll) i folled the same steps as above to locate the cvs file I just needed to change the title of the file I was using.
In this assignment I needed to count the number of votes. To do so I created a code that would simply count the number of rows.
I then needed to find the unqiue names so I used this function .append().
By this time I alrready have varables set so I use my variables to create a code that would cound how many votes each candidate recieved.
And lastly I used the .item() function to calculate who the winner candidate was 
To gather all my findings I repeated the steps from above I printed and exported my files to a tet file.
